This project is a prototype for an idea of mine. In this project AI agents trying to move from their spawning building to a targeted spot while towers trying to stop them. Towers target the nearest AI agent. 
Agents can die and in death they stand still. Player here tries to help the agents by 'resurrecting' the dead ones, by casting yellow spell, but if they stay dead for a time they 'decay' and turn in to bone pile (represented by turning in to stick). 
In this case they can be 'reanimated', by casting green spell, as skeletons (represented by stick figure) and if a skeleton dies they can be revived with both of the spells but if they stay dead for long they are removed meaning they don't leave a bone pile behind.
